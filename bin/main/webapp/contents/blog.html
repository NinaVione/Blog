But farmer Dave Issac has reluctantly decided to sell Floss as she is now too big to get through his farmyard gates - because she is a Peugeot estate car. Mr Issac, 46, who lives on an 180-acre farm near Battle in East Sussex, converted the family car into a working sheep dog in tribute to his dog which had recently died."
		document.getElementById("post_2").innerHTML = "From gingerbread to eggnog, toffee nut to roasted hazelnut, lattes bursting with a flavour of Christmas tempt us each year.But rather than thinking of the delicious nectar as 'just a coffee', the hidden calories and high sugar levels lurking in your festive cup mean it should really come with a health warning. Warming and tasty though they are, the majority contain more than a person's daily recommended sugar intake in one medium-sized portion. And going skinny won't help either. In many cases, drinks made from skimmed milk contained more sugar than full fat options. Either way, drinking one every day until Christmas could see your weight creep up by half a stone, experts warn."
